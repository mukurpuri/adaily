## What Adaily is NOT

| Never This              | Why                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Trading tips            | Creates anxiety, not our lane    |
| Stock picks             | Speculation ≠ financial health   |
| "Grow 10x" promises     | Hype destroys trust              |
| Urgent notifications    | Calm > chaos                     |
| Comparison with others  | Your journey, your pace          |

## The Test

Everything we build must pass this test:

> *"Does this make the user feel calmer and more confident about money?"*

If yes → build it.
If no → skip it.

---

## One-Line Vision

> **"Adaily: Your calm, steady comrade for all things money. No selling. No judging. Just clarity, one step at a time."**

---

## North Star Metric

> **"Did this person leave less confused than when they arrived?"**

Not DAU, not revenue, not signups — just: did we help?
